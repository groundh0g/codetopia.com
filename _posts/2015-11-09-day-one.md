Thanks to internal bleeding that put me in [the hospital](https://twitter.com/groundh0g/status/639941829799059457), I lost a little less than half my blood over [Labor Day weekend](https://www.facebook.com/groundh0g/posts/10153625950463679). I've been working from home since I was discharged, but that's no longer an option. So, I'm taking a little time off from work to wrap up the recovery process.

While I'm off, for the next four weeks, I'll be working on the new book. Today starts my [#30DaysOfWriting](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%2330DaysOfWriting%20%40groundh0g) for [*MonoGame: Code Camps*]({{ BASE_PATH }}/book/codecamps/).

I have to have the book ready for the next [game programming camp]({{ BASE_PATH }}/camps/) in June, 2016. The next month should provide a nice jump start towards that goal.

P.S. While you're waiting for the new book, check out my 2015 pun book, [*Fauxcabulary*]({{ BASE_PATH }}/books/).
