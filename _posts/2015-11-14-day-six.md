It's already day 6 of my [#30DaysOfWriting](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%2330DaysOfWriting%20%40groundh0g) for [*MonoGame: Code Camps*]({{ BASE_PATH }}/book/codecamps/)? Jeez.

[Fanny Pack](http://fpack.moreoncode.com/)'s Sprite Fonts tool is still occupying the lion's share of my time. The tool includes 2000+ freeware and OFL fonts for use in your games. Next step is to add support for importing your own truetype fonts.

This project has been a real challenge. From the tool to scrape commercial-use-friendly fonts from various vendors, to implementing the indexing and searching of those fonts, to presenting a decent user interface for wading through so many resources. But, I'm happy with the results so far.

My mom and dad have come to visit this weekend, so I'm not sure how much I'll get done over the next two days, but the current plan is to wrap up the Sprite Fonts module so that I can get back to churning out code and text for the book.
