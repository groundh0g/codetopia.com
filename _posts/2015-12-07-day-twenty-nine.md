My [#30DaysOfWriting](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%2330DaysOfWriting%20%40groundh0g) for [*MonoGame: Code Camps*]({{ BASE_PATH }}/book/codecamps/) has come to an end.

[Fanny Pack](http://fpack.moreoncode.com/)'s Sprite Fonts tool completely monopolized my time, but I have no regrets. It's shaping up to become a powerful open source tool for game development. I expect to have a usable version of the tool posted by year's end. Progress will be slower now that I've returned to work.

I don't consider the time spent on [Fanny Pack](http://fpack.moreoncode.com/) as wasted in the least. Of the three planned tools, [Sprite Sheets](http://fpack.moreoncode.com/sheets.html) and [Sprite Fonts](http://fpack.moreoncode.com/fonts.html), will be used by every chapter of the book.

My goal is still to wrap up the book (well, the first edition) before [the 2016 summer camp](http://codetopia.com/camps/index.html#2016).

For the curious, you can check out the current iteration of the font picker dialog by visiting [the preview page](http://fpack.moreoncode.com/fontsPreview.html). If you know of any sources for free-for-commercial-use fonts, feel free to leave a link in the comments. I appreciate your help. I'm currently pulling fonts from the following sources:

* [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
* [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/)
* [Font SC](http://www.fontsc.com/index.html)
* [Font Library](https://fontlibrary.org/)
* [ByPeople](http://www.bypeople.com/free-fonts/) (coming soon)
