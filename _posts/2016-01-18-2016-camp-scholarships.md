It's been in the works since June of 2015, but I'm making the announcement today.

> <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/152079445" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/152079445">2016 Game Programming Camp Scholarship</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user47318780">groundh0g</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

I'm sponsoring two young ladies to attend a game programming camp in North Carolina this summer.

If you know any students [who qualify](http://why2k.org/news/2015/12/19/scholarship-rules/) and have an interest in games or how they're made, please make sure this info gets into their hands.
